//i. FizzBuzz: print out the numbers from 1 to N, one per line. BUT:

//ii. If a number is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz” instead of the number. AND:

//iii. If a number is divisible by 5, print out “Buzz” instead of the number. 

//EXCEPT:

//iv. If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “FizzBuzz” instead of the 

//number.

//v. And -- create a brand new Visual Studio solution, including a separate 

//project to hold your tests.
