1) DON'T RUN THIS YET!  :-)
2) Open up Form1.cs, and look at the code.
3) Wherever you see "questions", fill in what you think the 
program will be doing at that point.
4) When you've answered all of the questions, run the program and compare 
your observations with the answers you gave.  Don't change your answers!
5) Wherever your answers didn't match the behavior of the program, write down
why you think the program did what it did.
6) Experiment with the program until you understand its behavior.
