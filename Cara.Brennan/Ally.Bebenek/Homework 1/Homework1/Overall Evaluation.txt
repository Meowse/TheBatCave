I've written individual evaluations for all of Homework 1.  As I was reading
the assignments, and writing the evaluations, it occurred to me more than
once that the code and/or evaluations might be useful to the whole class.

Thus, I have provided a brief index to the code and evaluations.  I 
encourage you all to read the evaluations and code listed below, as you
will probably find useful ideas in most or all of them.

Index to the Homework 1 code and evaluations:
	
	a) Alex: for several interesting code constructs and some good 
	dynamic UI behavior, as well as an introduction to refactoring.
	b) Amy: for a discussion of the "Environment.NewLine" constant.
	c) Bryan Scown: for the use of local variables and constants, 
	and a discussion of string manipulation functions and user interface.
	d) Eva: because it addresses important concepts in the UX (User 
	Experience) problem space.
	e) Gordon: for use of an instance variable and the TextChanged
	event on TextBox.
	f) Jay: for use of DateTime.Now to display the current date and
	time.
	g) Mary: for a good point about why one might want to use a local 
	variable to hold the value to be displayed, rather than just displaying 
	the TextBox's value directly.
	h) Mike (Futala): for error handling, and responding to clicks on a label.
	i) Su: for modifying properties of the Controls other than the text,
	position, and size.  In specific, changing the color of the label text.
	j) Tiina: for handling click events from two different controls with
	the same event-handler method, and for a link to a really valuable 
	educational philosophy article.
